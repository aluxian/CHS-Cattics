# Cattics
Community for Cat Lovers! Inspired by [500px.com](http://500px.com).

# Description
The website is in a pretty basic form, I tried to make a community for cat owners but it doesn't have that many features implemented right now.

# Goal
- Social network authentication
- Owners able to register, have profiles, follow other owners, heart cats, create their cats' profiles, add photos
- Photo competitions for cats/owners

# Technical Stuff
- Built on the [Angular Fullstack Yo Generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) framework
- Node.js + Express + MongoDB on back-end
- AngularJS + Bootstrap + SASS on front-end

# Deployment
    mongod          // have a mongo db running
    npm install     // install node deps
    bower install   // install frontend libs
    grunt build     // run server
